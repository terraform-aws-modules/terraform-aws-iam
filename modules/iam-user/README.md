# iam-user

Creates IAM user, IAM login profile, IAM access key and uploads IAM SSH user public key. All of these are optional resources.

## Notes for keybase users

**If possible, always use PGP encryption to prevent Terraform from keeping unencrypted password and access secret key in state file.**

### Keybase pre-requisits

When `pgp_key` is specified as `keybase:username`, make sure that that user has already uploaded public key to keybase.io. For example, user with username `test` has done it properly and you can [verify it here](https://keybase.io/test/pgp_keys.asc).

### How to decrypt user's encrypted password and secret key

This module outputs commands and PGP messages which can be decrypted either using [keybase.io web-site](https://keybase.io/decrypt) or using command line to get user's password and user's secret key:
- `keybase_password_decrypt_command`
- `keybase_secret_key_decrypt_command`
- `keybase_password_pgp_message`
- `keybase_secret_key_pgp_message`

## Requirements

| Name | Version |
|------|---------|
| terraform | >= 0.12.6 |
| aws | >= 2.50 |

## Providers

| Name | Version |
|------|---------|
| aws | >= 2.50 |

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| create\_iam\_access\_key | Whether to create IAM access key | `bool` | `true` | no |
| create\_iam\_user\_login\_profile | Whether to create IAM user login profile | `bool` | `true` | no |
| create\_user | Whether to create the IAM user | `bool` | `true` | no |
| force\_destroy | When destroying this user, destroy even if it has non-Terraform-managed IAM access keys, login profile or MFA devices. Without force\_destroy a user with non-Terraform-managed access keys and login profile will fail to be destroyed. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| name | Desired name for the IAM user | `string` | n/a | yes |
| password\_length | The length of the generated password | `number` | `20` | no |
| password\_reset\_required | Whether the user should be forced to reset the generated password on first login. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| path | Desired path for the IAM user | `string` | `"/"` | no |
| permissions\_boundary | The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the user. | `string` | `""` | no |
| pgp\_key | Either a base-64 encoded PGP public key, or a keybase username in the form `keybase:username`. Used to encrypt password and access key. `pgp_key` is required when `create_iam_user_login_profile` is set to `true` | `string` | `""` | no |
| ssh\_key\_encoding | Specifies the public key encoding format to use in the response. To retrieve the public key in ssh-rsa format, use SSH. To retrieve the public key in PEM format, use PEM | `string` | `"SSH"` | no |
| ssh\_public\_key | The SSH public key. The public key must be encoded in ssh-rsa format or PEM format | `string` | `""` | no |
| tags | A map of tags to add to all resources. | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| upload\_iam\_user\_ssh\_key | Whether to upload a public ssh key to the IAM user | `bool` | `false` | no |

## Outputs

|------|-------------|
| keybase\_password\_decrypt\_command | Decrypt user password command |
| keybase\_password\_pgp\_message | Encrypted password |
| keybase\_secret\_key\_decrypt\_command | Decrypt access secret key command |
| keybase\_secret\_key\_pgp\_message | Encrypted access secret key |
| pgp\_key | PGP key used to encrypt sensitive data for this user (if empty - secrets are not encrypted) |
| this\_iam\_access\_key\_encrypted\_secret | The encrypted secret, base64 encoded |
| this\_iam\_access\_key\_id | The access key ID |
| this\_iam\_access\_key\_key\_fingerprint | The fingerprint of the PGP key used to encrypt the secret |
| this\_iam\_access\_key\_secret | The access key secret |
| this\_iam\_access\_key\_ses\_smtp\_password\_v4 | The secret access key converted into an SES SMTP password by applying AWS's Sigv4 conversion algorithm |
| this\_iam\_access\_key\_status | Active or Inactive. Keys are initially active, but can be made inactive by other means. |
| this\_iam\_user\_arn | The ARN assigned by AWS for this user |
| this\_iam\_user\_login\_profile\_encrypted\_password | The encrypted password, base64 encoded |
| this\_iam\_user\_login\_profile\_key\_fingerprint | The fingerprint of the PGP key used to encrypt the password |
| this\_iam\_user\_name | The user's name |
| this\_iam\_user\_ssh\_key\_fingerprint | The MD5 message digest of the SSH public key |
| this\_iam\_user\_ssh\_key\_ssh\_public\_key\_id | The unique identifier for the SSH public key |
| this\_iam\_user\_unique\_id | The unique ID assigned by AWS |
