# iam-user

Creates IAM user, IAM login profile, IAM access key and uploads IAM SSH user public key. All of these are optional resources.

## Notes for keybase users

**If possible, always use PGP encryption to prevent Terraform from keeping unencrypted password and access secret key in state file.**

### Keybase pre-requisits

When `pgp_key` is specified as `keybase:username`, make sure that that user has already uploaded public key to keybase.io. For example, user with username `test` has done it properly and you can [verify it here](https://keybase.io/test/pgp_keys.asc).

### How to decrypt user's encrypted password and secret key

This module outputs commands and PGP messages which can be decrypted either using [keybase.io web-site](https://keybase.io/decrypt) or using command line to get user's password and user's secret key:
- `keybase_password_decrypt_command`
- `keybase_secret_key_decrypt_command`
- `keybase_password_pgp_message`
- `keybase_secret_key_pgp_message`

| create_iam_user_login_profile | Whether to create IAM user login profile | string | `true` | no |
| create_user | Whether to create the IAM user | string | `true` | no |
| force_destroy | When destroying this user, destroy even if it has non-Terraform-managed IAM access keys, login profile or MFA devices. Without force_destroy a user with non-Terraform-managed access keys and login profile will fail to be destroyed. | string | `false` | no |
| name | Desired name for the IAM user | string | - | yes |
| password_length | The length of the generated password | string | `20` | no |
| password_reset_required | Whether the user should be forced to reset the generated password on first login. | string | `true` | no |
| path | Desired path for the IAM user | string | `/` | no |
| permissions_boundary | The policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the user | string | `` | no |
| pgp_key | Either a base-64 encoded PGP public key, or a keybase username in the form keybase:username. Used to encrypt password and access key. | string | `` | no |
| ssh_key_encoding | Specifies the public key encoding format to use in the response. To retrieve the public key in ssh-rsa format, use SSH. To retrieve the public key in PEM format, use PEM | string | `SSH` | no |
| ssh_public_key | The SSH public key. The public key must be encoded in ssh-rsa format or PEM format | string | `` | no |
| upload_iam_user_ssh_key | Whether to upload a public ssh key to the IAM user | string | `false` | no |
